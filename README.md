# 👨🏻‍💻 Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This repository showcases my complete, industry-standard, end-to-end data analytics workflow, designed to mirror the real responsibilities of professional analysts in modern business environments. It demonstrates my ability to take raw data and transform it into actionable business intelligence through preparation, modeling, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

This project highlights my skills in:

📊 Building a strong Portfolio Project for interviews and LinkedIn

📚 Applying Python, SQL, and Power BI in real-world analytics scenarios

💼 Delivering insights that align with professional Data Analytics, Data Science, and Product Analytics roles

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to simulate a corporate-grade analytics workflow and prove my ability to translate raw customer data into strategic insights.

Here’s what I accomplished:

✅ Data Preparation, Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Cleaned and transformed the dataset, explored patterns, and prepared it for deeper analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Designed and executed queries to simulate business transactions, uncover customer segments, loyalty trends, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Built an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Reporting & Presentation: Compiled findings into a clear report and created a presentation deck to communicate insights and actionable recommendations effectively.

## 🛠️ How I Built This Project

1. Worked in Jupyter Notebook (Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb)

Imported and explored the dataset

Cleaned and transformed data

Connected Python to SQL database

2. Loaded data into SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MS SQL Server)

Created database schema

Ran Python scripts to load data

Wrote SQL queries (customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql) to answer business questions

3. Connected SQL Database to Power BI

Designed and published an interactive dashboard (customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix)

4. Created Report & Presentation

Summarized findings in a structured report

Built a presentation deck using Gamma AI to communicate insights visually
